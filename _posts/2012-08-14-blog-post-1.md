<!-- I needed to write a blog post, so I wanted to share a bit about my expereince as a gymnast. I don't think it is good (as it could be written in a manner that's much more fun to read and less cliche), but it highlights my main takeaways from the sport.  -->

<!-- I started doing gymnastics when I was 2, trained for 19 years, quit 3 times, have multiple boxes of medals (1 for each time I quit) somewhere in my attic (as per the standard), hold William & Mary's record on Highbar, and am an NCAA All American. While I no longer actively involved in the sport, here are my thoughts on what I believe to be the most critical aspects. -->
TODO: I started writing something, but didn't like it. So I will come back to this later.

For fun, here's what Chat GPT Said:

**Andrew Lyubovsky** You are a gymnast who believes that gymnastics is a team sport and a science. Please explain using 100 words or less.

**ChatGPT** As a gymnast, I understand the importance of individual skill and performance, but I also recognize the significant impact of team dynamics and scientific principles in the sport. Gymnastics requires teamwork and collaboration to create a cohesive and successful routine. Additionally, understanding the physics behind movements and the body's mechanics is essential for executing skills safely and efficiently. A deep knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics can aid in injury prevention and performance optimization. Overall, gymnastics is not only a display of physical prowess but also a team effort and a scientific pursuit.
<!-- It's commonly believed that gymnastics is an individual sport. Which is totally true. You go out there and just do a routine by yourself. Yet this black and white description of it being an individual sport totally misses the point of what a team sport really is. The most important aspect of a team sport isn't that you can pass the ball to someone else instead of scoring yoursef, rather its the role that your teammates and the people around you play on your performance. This is certainly the case for gymnsatics. For me, as well as many other gymnasts, the team nature of the sport came to play an increasinlgy large role in college, where my teammates would constantly correct me, and where I could look at what they were doing and copy the things that I thoguht made sense. Secondly, the team nature comes into play outside of the gym. After pracitces, we were constantly studying together. And by studying I mean having school books open and watching gymnastics videos, and discussing things that we should be doing in the gym. This would usually go on until ~2 or ~3 AM. This is the kind of motivation and care from other gymnasts is perciely what made the sport so fun, rewarding, and it's the impact of this culture that makes it a team sport. -->

<!-- Gymnastics as a science

Gymnastics is without a doubt a science. There is a rule book that people have to follow that tells how different routines will be scored. Based on this rule book people create routines that they compete. The science nature of it comes from the loopholes, where some skills are easier but give more value. In highschool our coach would know what skills to learn and tell us to learn them. Unfortuantely, this sort of guidance (in most cases) determines the level at which a gymnast will be performing. Second, is the science of knowing how to be healthy enough to have effective practices. Whether it's getting enough sleep at night, eating lots of carbs after practice, or drinking coffee before practice, there were several tricks that we learned that allowed us to feel good at practices. And lastly, it was being able to mannage different factors such as how intense training was or how much sleep we got the previous night to balance the training intensity. This knowledge plays a crutial role, yet unfortunately it requires athletic trainers and proper guidance to fully capture it (as with any other science).


Good Vibes
I think the thing that I will remember most from the sport is the types of vibes that I got in the gym. Here are the three I will recall the most. I remember clearly coming into the gym my freshman year after winter break, and seeing everyone. And there was a glowing feeling made practice easy and made me remember it four years later. Second, is the normal feeling when you know exactly what you need to be doing, and you are happy. Even if you are hurting, or if something isn't working out, the feeling is still good as you know what you will do depending on how things are going. Lastly, there are those days when teammates or coaches may be fussing. These days suck. It's better to just take these days chill, forget about them, and laugh about them 4 years later. Overall, I think it is the good vibes that I will remember about the gym.  -->
